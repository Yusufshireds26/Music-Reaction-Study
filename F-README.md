Music-Reaction-Study
This project explores how different music conditions (no music, fast music, and slow music) affect participants reaction times. The analysis leverages data simulation, statistical testing, and visualization techniques to determine whether background music significantly influences cognitive behavior.

** Tools & Libraries

Python
Pandas, NumPy (data wrangling & simulation)
SciPy (Anova statistical testing)
Seaborn, Matplotlib (data visualization)
*** Overview *Data Simulation

Generated synthetic reaction time data for thirty participants under three music conditions.
Introduced variation using normal distriubutions to mimic realistic scenarios. *Statisical Analysis (ANOVA)
Applied one way ANOVA to test whether mean reaction times differ significantly across conditions. *Visualization.
Boxplots to compare distribution of reaction times by conditon.
Histograms with KDE overlays to visualize overall trends.
**** Key Insights -Identifies whether music speeds up, slows down, or has no affect on reaction times. -Provides visual and statistical evidence to suppport findings. -Demonstrates applied use of data science & machine learning tools for cognitive research.
